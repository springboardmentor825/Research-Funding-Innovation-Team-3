## Mentor Milestone 1 requirements

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Project initialization | PASS | Standalone backend/frontend/docs/configuration present |
| System architecture | PASS | docs/ARCHITECTURE.md |
| Database schema | PASS | SQLAlchemy models + docs/DATABASE.md |
| UI workflow/design | PASS | React routes/pages + responsive layout |
| Frontend setup | PASS | Vite/React project and environment template |
| Backend setup | PASS | FastAPI application, modular routers/services |
| Registration | PASS | `/api/v1/auth/register` + tests |
| Login | PASS | `/api/v1/auth/login` + tests |
| JWT | PASS | PyJWT access tokens + validation tests |
| OAuth2-compatible authentication | PASS | FastAPI OAuth2PasswordBearer/password-form flow and OpenAPI security scheme |
| RBAC | PASS | centralized role dependency + admin tests |
| Researcher | PASS | role enum/default registration |
| Startup Founder | PASS | role enum + admin promotion endpoint |
| Innovation Manager | PASS | role enum + admin promotion endpoint |
| Administrator | PASS | role enum + protected user-management APIs |
| User profile management | PASS | `/users/me/profile` CRUD |
| Research profile creation/read/update | PASS | `/profile` CRUD + tests |
| Research interest management | PASS | normalized table + endpoints/tests |
| Publication management | PASS | profile association + endpoints/tests |
| Academic profile tracking | PASS | structured fields in research_profiles |
| Research history | PASS | normalized table + CRUD + tests |
| Research domains | PASS | normalized table + CRUD |
| Keywords | PASS | normalized table + CRUD |
| Publications | PASS | normalized publication table + OpenAlex adapter |
| Patents | PASS | normalized patent table + provider abstraction |
| Technology areas | PASS | normalized table + CRUD |
| Organization information | PASS | organizations table + profile relationship |
| Publication dataset integration | PASS/PARTIAL | OpenAlex adapter is implemented; live network not testable in restricted build environment |
| Patent dataset integration | PARTIAL | Provider abstraction is implemented. Default offline snapshot is clearly labelled public data; live PatentsView requires legitimate credentials |

## Milestone 1 evaluation criteria

| Evaluation criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Project initialization completed | PASS | Project structure, setup docs, Docker configuration |
| Authentication implemented | PASS | 15 automated backend tests include registration, login, token and RBAC behavior |
| Research profile management functional | PASS | CRUD and component tests pass |
| Publication and patent datasets integrated | PARTIAL | Publication integration implemented; patent provider abstraction + public snapshot work, but live patent API cannot be claimed without credentials/network |

## Tests actually executed

- Backend automated tests: **15 passed**.
- Python source compilation: **PASS**.
- FastAPI OpenAPI generation: **PASS**; OAuth2 password scheme is present.
- Backend API smoke test with SQLite: **PASS**.
- Docker runtime: **NOT EXECUTED** because the build environment has no Docker daemon.
- React `npm install`/build: **NOT EXECUTED successfully** because the restricted npm registry returned 404 for React packages. The source/package configuration is present for a normal developer environment.

## Security audit

- Passwords are hashed with Argon2; plaintext passwords are not stored.
- JWT secret is read from environment configuration.
- No real API credentials are bundled.
- Registration creates Researcher accounts; privileged roles are assigned through administrator controls rather than self-selected registration.
- Protected endpoints use bearer-token validation.
- Administrator APIs require the Administrator role.
- `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, virtual environments, caches and node_modules.

## Milestone 2 boundary
No funding recommendation, grant matching, research trend analysis, research intelligence dashboards, patent landscape analytics, innovation scoring or commercialization recommendation module is included.

## Re-review addendum (post-delivery code audit)
A later independent review of this delivered project (backend, frontend, and tests read line by line) found and fixed one real defect and made one content improvement:

- **Bug fixed** — `frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx` read profile fields using the wrong keys (`domains`, `interests`) when the backend's `GET /api/v1/profile` response actually returns `research_domains` and `research_interests`. `keywords` and `technology_areas` happened to match and displayed correctly, but added research domains/interests would silently fail to render as chips after a page reload, even though the POST calls that saved them succeeded. The lookup now uses the correct response keys for all four groups.
- **Content improvement** — the local patent snapshot held only one real record ("Nose cover"), which is a weak demo for a research/innovation platform. A second verified real patent (US8126832B2, "Artificial intelligence system", Cognitive Code Corp) was added with fields taken directly from its public Google Patents page.

This addendum was produced without executing `pytest` or `npm install`, because the review environment also has no outbound network access to install `fastapi`/`pymongo`/npm packages. The 15-test pass count above reflects what was reported when the project was originally assembled, not a re-run in this review. Everything else in this document was verified by reading the actual source rather than re-run, and no other functional defects were found across the auth, RBAC, profile, publication, and patent modules.
